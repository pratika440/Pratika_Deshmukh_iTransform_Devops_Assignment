Create a script that interacts with the user. You will want to prompt the user to enter the following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):

FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE

Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.

Ans:

echo "FIRSTNAME:$1"
echo "LASTNAME:$2"
echo "USERAGE:$3"

#num=$(($3+10))
#echo "Hello $1 $2 $num"


Output:

FIRSTNAME:Pratika
LASTNAME:Deshmukh
USERAGE:13
Hello Pratika Deshmukh 23
