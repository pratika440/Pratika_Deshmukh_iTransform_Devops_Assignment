Write a script that takes a single command line parameter intended to be the user's first name. Prompt the user for their age and read that into a variable. Using the appropriate method to make that command line parameter visible to a function, pass the age captured to the function and display a message to the user addressing them by name and confirming their age, add a calculation of their age in number of days.

Ans :

echo "Name:$1"
echo "age:$2"
echo "Is this ur real age"
read answer
case "$answer" in 
y)
 num=$(($2*365))
   echo "Your name is $1 and your number of days are $num"
 ;;
n)
    echo "Please enter ur correct age"
    ;;
    esac


Output :

$ ./hiiScript.sh Pratika 20
Name:Pratika
age:20
Is this ur real age
y
Your name is Pratika and your number of days are 7300

$ ./hiiScript.sh Pratika 20
Name:Pratika
age:20
Is this ur real age
n
Please enter ur correct age
