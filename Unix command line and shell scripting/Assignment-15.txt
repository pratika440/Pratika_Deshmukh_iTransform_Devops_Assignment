Create a script that prompts the user for a number. That number is to be used to display a simple message to the terminal X number of times (where X is the number captured from the user input). The message should include an indication of the number for each count the message is displayed.

Ans: 

i=1
while [ $i -le $1 ]
do
echo "$i Hello World"
i=$(($i+1))
done


Output:

1 Hello World
2 Hello World
3 Hello World
4 Hello World
5 Hello World
