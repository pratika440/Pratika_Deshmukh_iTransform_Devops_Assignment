Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run. Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, using inline comments, what each command is doing.

Ans:

!/usr/bin/bash

Firstname=Pratika
Lastname=Deshmukh

echo "Firstname is " $Firstname
echo "Lastname is " $Lastname


Output:

$ ./hiiScript.sh
Firstname is  Pratika
Lastname is  Pradip
